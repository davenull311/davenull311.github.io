            <p>Hey there, I'm Dave!</p> 
            <p>I'm a versatile tech pro with over five years of experience under my belt, blending roles as a Software Engineer, Cloud Engineer, and Technical Program Manager. I’ve led everything from end-to-end cloud migrations and automation projects to cross-functional teams delivering data-driven solutions for high-profile government and defense initiatives. I’m an Azure whiz (and pretty handy with AWS too!), always focused on designing secure, scalable, and cost-effective PaaS solutions.</p>
            <p>I also thrive on managing complex go-to-market projects and aligning technical strategies with business goals—whether that's through cloud architecture, data analytics, or collaborative efforts with sales, customer success, and operations teams. With a strong customer-centric approach and a background in military leadership, I bring clarity and efficiency to even the most challenging environments. Let’s build something great together!</p>
            <p>I believe in continuous learning and am always excited to tackle new challenges.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me spending quality time with my wife and three kids, playing hockey, or toodling on a guitar or drum kit.</p>
