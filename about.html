        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <section class="about-section">
            <p>Hey there, I’m Dave!</p>
            <p>I'm a Software Engineer and Technical Leader with over five years of experience crafting scalable, secure, and impactful digital solutions. I thrive at the intersection of code and strategy, designing cloud-native architectures and leading cross-functional teams to deliver high-stakes projects for government, defense, and enterprise clients.</p>
            <p>My sweet spot? Architecting distributed systems that solve real-world problems. At FI Consulting, I led the charge on the PPP Review solution—a cloud-based powerhouse built with Azure Databricks and Docker that slashed processing times by 75% and boosted fraud detection accuracy by 90%. Whether I’m containerizing apps for seamless deployment, building load-balanced REST APIs with Zero Trust security, or driving Agile processes as a Certified Scrum Master, I’m all about creating systems that are modular, efficient, and ready to scale.</p>
            <p>Now, about that last name — Null. Yes, it’s the bane of every database and programmer’s existence, and it’s been a quirky thorn in my side throughout my tech career. From breaking forms that can’t handle a “null” value to sparking inevitable chuckles in code reviews (“Did Null write this?”), it’s taught me patience, problem-solving, and how to laugh at myself. In a field where “null” means nothing, I’ve made it my mission to deliver something — robust, reliable solutions that stand up to any challenge.</p>
            <p>I’m an Azure expert (with AWS in my toolkit too!) and love aligning technical execution with business goals. From collaborating with product managers and IT leadership to mentoring junior devs, I bring a customer-first mindset and a knack for clarity—honed through years of military leadership as a Marine Corps Corporal. When I’m not coding or dreaming up the next big solution, you’ll catch me chasing pucks on the hockey rink, jamming on guitar or drums, or hanging out with my wife and three kids. I’m a lifelong learner, always up for a challenge, and excited to build something awesome with you.</p>
